# PlayersAnalysis

Task of this analysis is to predict whether a player will pay or not. Penalized Logistic regression and Random Forests have been used 
for prediction. Penalty can be either ridge or Lasso, but choosing lasso penalty has an advantage that it does variable
selection too.
K-means clustering is used to segment different groupings of players, and then propose some campaigns based on that.

Any suggestions or comments are welcomed.
